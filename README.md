# CPPN.js
A litle website for interactive generative art.

Compositional Patern Producing Networks, [CPPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network) for short are a family of randomly initilalized neural netoworks that produce fancy patterns. This react app generates sush networks and makes them a bit interactive by making them respond to the mouse hovering above the image.

The app uses tensorflow.js for making neural netowks that run in the browser.

## Setup
install the requirements:
`yarn install`

run the app localy:
`yarn start`

deploy the app to github pages:
`yarn deploy`
